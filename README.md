# MyReactJS

## Introduction

This is a sample boilerplate web-application to get started with building SPA using React JS. Most of the setup has been built out of the box. This includes:

* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
* [Webpack hot reload (react-hot-reload)](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/)
* [ES6 support](http://es6-features.org/)
* [ES Lint](https://eslint.org/)
* [ES Lint AirBnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
* [Prettier (Code formatter)](https://prettier.io/)
* [Flow (Static type checker)](https://flow.org/en/)

This project works well with Visual Studio Code. The following extensions are required to fully utilise features such as Prettier and Flow:

* [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
